[Scene 7__
Oh thank god... It’s so nice to hear someone else’s voice. It’s been an eternity since I’ve talked to someone. Any longer and It would have driven me nuts.+__

I-I don’t know... I think so. I’ve been stuck on this island for 2 days... or 3... I’ve lost perception of time... I’m the only one, there’s not a single soul here. I’ve been feeding myself with pre-made food cans I found in these buildings.+__

<(9)1 - Where are you ?>__
<(10)2 - Why did you call me ?>__
<(11)3 - Enough questions... is that a prank call ?>__

[Scene 9__
I’ve no idea how I got here, the last few days of my life have been blurry as hell, I can’t even remember what day it is.+__

I’m all alone on this weird island, I’ve been looking for someone for hours now, and all I was able to find is more ruins. This place is covered in those, it’s like an abandonned city.+__

How can such a place even exist?+__

It’s all just like a bad hangover.+__

<(10)1 - Why did you call me ?>__
<(8)2 - Are you in danger ?>__
<(11)3 - Enough questions... is that a prank call ?>__

[Scene 10__
I can’t even tell! I just found this old ass flip phone on one of the shelves in this supermarket! I just picked it up and there we are!+__
 
Turns out you’re the only contact on this stupid piece of trash, and it just called automatically!+__

<(8)1 - Are you in danger ?>__
<(9)2 - Where are you ?>__
<(11)3 - Enough questions... is that a prank call ?>__

[Scene 11__
I swear to god it’s not!!!+__

Listen, seems like you’re the only one I can rely on right now. You’re literally the first person I’ve talked to in the past few hours, or even days!+__

You’re my only way to communicate with the outside world, it’s just a question of my own sanity at this point.+__
