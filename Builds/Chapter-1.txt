*SHKRRRRRR*-MY GOD ! I’ve been stuck here-*SHKRRRRRRRRRRR*-days, it feels so good to hear someone’s voice..._
*SHKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*-any idea what’s going on ? Who are y-*SHKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*-am I here ?+__

<(6)1 - What ? I can’t understand half of what you're saying !...__
<(5)2 - Who are you ?__

... A-are you there ? Can you hear me better ?+__

<(7)1 - I think so ?__
]

[Scene 7 ???__
Oh thank god... It’s so nice to hear someone else’s voice.+__
It’s been an eternity since I’ve talked to someone. Any longer and It would have driven me nuts.+__

<(8)1 - Are you in danger ?__
<(9)2 - Where are you ?__
<(10)3 - Why did you call me ?__
]

[Scene 8 ???__
I-I don’t know... I’ve been stuck on this island for two days... or three... Can't tell anymore...+__
It really look like I’m the only one, there’s not a single soul here.+__

<(9)1 - Where are you ?__
<(10)2 - Why did you call me ?__
<(11)3 - Stop. is that a prank call ?__
]

[Scene 9 ???__
Actually in a sort of supermarket. The last few days of my life have been blurry as hell, I can’t even remember_
what day it is!+__

I-I’m all alone on this weird island, I’ve been looking for someone for hours now, and all I was able to find is_
more ruins, it- it's like an abandonned city.+__

How can such a place even exist ?+__

It’s all just like a bad hangover.+__

<(8)1 - Are you in danger ?__
<(10)2 - Why call me tough ?__
<(11)3 - Enough questions... is that a prank call ?__
]

[Scene 10 ???__
I can’t even tell ! I just found this old ass... flip phone on one of the shelves, just picked it up and it-it_
started a call as soon as I opened it !__
There isn't anithing else on that piece of trash, no contacts or any internet access, only+ this Call...+__

<(8)1 - Are you in danger ?__
<(9)2 - Where are you ?__
<(11)3 - Cut it off, just tell that's a prank ?__
]

[Scene 11 ???__
I swear to god it’s not !!!+__

Listen, seems like you’re the only one I can rely on right now. You’re literally the first person I’ve talked to in_
the past few hours, or even days !+__
You’re my only way to communicate with the outside world, it’s just a question of my own sanity at this point.+__

<(18) 1 - Okay, just keep calm, maybe you could find some help by exploring the building ?__
]

[Scene 18 ???__
O- Okay!... I gotta get out of the building first, just stay with me.+__
*You hear the person’s footsteps echoing through the supermarket*+__
This place is huge, you don’t realize that until the mall’s empty.+__
...+__
Just, what happened he- +__
...+__
I hear something.+ Mechanical screeching kind of noise.+__

<(19) 1 - Sounds dangerous. Can’t you just go back ?__
<(20) 2 - Maybe there's someone there ! You should go see where it comes from__
]

[Scene 19 ???__
I've been exploring this island for hours now and I've find nothing back where I was.+__
It's the first time I hear something else than the wind or the waves hitting the shore, so I'm not turning my back_
now.+__
If there's any living soul in here that knows what the fuck is going on, I'll go and talk to them.+__

<(21) 1| - Do it. It will not be my fault if you get hurt.__
<(20) 2@ - You might be right, any help is welcome at this point.__
]

[Scene 20 ???__
I hope this thing will not be hostile.+__
...+__
... Not gonna lie, I'm kind of shitting my pants right now. I'll try to be stealthy, never too sure...+__
*You hear a quiet breath and a machine noise slowly becoming louder*+__

<(22) 1 - So ? Who is it ?__
]

[Scene 21 ???__
You're not a kind one, huh ?+__
... If you continue talking to me with this tone...+__
You know what, fuck it.+__
I'm going to see where that noise come from.+__

<(22) 1 - So ? Who is it?__
]

[Scene 22 ???__
Shhhh...+__
Wait...+ I-It's an...+__
... It's just a freacking escalator...+__
... It goes weirdly fast, I've never seen any escalator be this speedy before!+__

<(23) 1 - Why is it making this much noise ?__
<(24) 2 - Why is it still working in an abandonned supermarket ?__
<(25) 3 - Where does it lead ?__
]

[Scene 23 ???__
It seems that the engine is overpowered. The escalator goes at a godly speed !+__
It rattles like a goddamn lawnmower.+__
What the-+ I can't even make up where are the steps, it's just so fast it's blurry !+__

<(24) 1 - Why is it still working in an abandonned supermarket ?__
<(25) 2 - Where does it lead ?__
<(26) 3 - Try to climb a step.__
<(27) 4 - Is there something else around you ?__
]

[Scene 24 ???__
I've got no idea !+__
All that remains here are only ruins.+__
Seems weird that the only working thing in this supermarket is a dysfunctionnal escalator that prevents me from_
going to the second floor.+__
It almost feels like this was made on purpose...+__
Damn me, I making the worst scenarios in my head now.+__

<(26) 1 - Maybe you'll get answers by going to the first floor.__
<(25) 2 - Where does it lead ?__
<(23) 3 - Why is it making this much noise ?__
<(27) 4 - Is there something else around you?__
]

[Scene 25 ???__
I... Can't tell.+__
Oh wait! There is sunlight up here! I think I can access a new part of the island if I go up here.__
Even if I don't think I can go fast enough to compete against this escalator eh !+__

<(26) 1 - Nice! Try to climb it then.__
<(24) 2 - Why is it still working in an abandonned supermarket ?__
<(23) 3 - Why is it making this much noise ?__
<(27) 4 - Is there something else around you ?__
]

[Scene 26 ???__
Hum...+__
Okay ? It might lead somewhere interesting.+__
I just have to...+ Take a step at the right...+ Time...+__
WOOAAH SHI- *THUMB*+__
...+__
...+__

<(27) 1| - Are you hurt ?!__
]

[Scene 27 ???__
...+__
Ouch...+__
That hurt as hell...+__
What a brillant idea you had ! Stepping on an out of control esc-OUCH!...+__
Would be nice if you don't advice me to be this idiotic next time... Okay ?+__

<(28) 1@ - Right, sorry for that.__
<(29) 2| - You're the one who decided to listen to me.__
]

[Scene 28 ???__
Yes, yes...+ No worries.+__
It's just a little scratch, I can handle that.+__
Anyway, there might be a way to stop that thing to go so fast.+__
This escalator seems to be the only way to move forward, so let's search for a solution.+__

<(30) 1 - What do you see around you ?__
]

[Scene 29 ???__
Fuck off !__
What tells me you didn't ask me to do that in purpose huh ?+__
...+__
Sorry, I'm overreacting, I just want to get out of here quickly.+__
Let's not be stupid and find a way up here without getting hurt.+__

<(30) 1 - What do you see around you ?__
]

[Scene 30 ???__
Right, uhmmm...+__
There seems to be two shelves that aren't empty in here.+__
There is this food section.+ I think I see some food cans and some fruits.+__
I can see a kind of craft section behind me too.+ There might be useful tools in here !+__

<(31) 1 - Go to the food section.__
<(32) 2 - Go to the craft section.__
]

[Scene 31 ???__
Okay !+__
I'm hungry as hell, I wouldn't say no to a little snack.+__
*footsteps*+__
...+ *snif*+__
OH G-...+ IT SMELLS TERRIBLE OVER HERE !+__
Shelves are filled with rotten fruits and vegeta-...+__
*glurp*+ Oh lord I almost threw up...+__

<(35) 1 - Might be a better idea to go to the craft section...__
<(36) 2 - Can you keep going? there might be something interesting here.__
]

[Scene 32 ???__
Right, let's go !+__
A good hammer is always useful, especially in the kind of situation I'm in I guess.+__
*footsteps*+__
... Alright! Here I am.+ There is far less things on the shelves than what I've imagined.+__
There is some door-wedge, packs of rusty nails and-Oh !+__
A huge wire cutting pliers ! That's what I'm talking about !+__
I'm picking it up.+ This might come handy if I have to smash something...+ Or someone.+__

<(38) 1 - Do you see anything else ?__
<(31) 2 - You might want to go look at the food shelves now.__
]

[Scene 35 ???__
Y-you're right... It's best to get out of here before I-...+ *footsteps*+__
... Oof, one more second and I think I would have passed out.+ Anyway, here I am.+__

<(38) 1 - Is there something else interesting ?__
]

[Scene 36 ???__
Yeah, I guess, but it's on-*glurp*...+ Only because you asked me nicely...+__
*footsteps*+__
... Good heavens, aren't these trash supposed to be eaten by the bugs righ-...+__
Weird, there's not a single a single fly out here...+__
Anyway, I'm almost out of here.+__

<(38) 1 - Is there something interesting ?__
]

[Scene 38 ???__
Let me see...+__
Ah AH!+ There's a door over here !+__
There is a sign with "Maintenance Room" marked on it.+__
Lucky me, it seems unlocked.+ *sound of door opening*+__
...+ Well yeah,+ that surely looks like a maintenance room, or more like an abandonned maintenance room.+__
... Oh my bad, seems to be one thing still working !+__

<(39) 1 - What is it ?__
]

[Scene 39 ???__
I-It's uuuuh...+__
A laptop, seems to be on the lockscreen.+__
There's a post-it attached on the upper right corner of it.+__
It says "vaccine rabies year"...+ I don't know when that thing was !+__
... What ?+ I don't remember how I got here in the first place, don't expect me to remember this !+__
Anyway, you might want to search for that on the internet, it's a 4 digits password.+ I'll try to log in.+__

<(40) 1 - Okay, go on, I'm searching that on my browser.__
]

[Scene 40 ???__
Just have to press enter and...+__
OH SHIT !!+__
THERE'S A FUCKING TIMER IN HERE, IT'S BEEPING !+__
I think the "vaccine rabies year" shit might be the password, FIND IT NOW !+__
I don't know what will happen if it reaches 0 BUT I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT !+__
HURRY UP, WHAT'S THE PASSWORD ?!+__
